# Wayback Machine

The Wayback Machine preserves older versions of and/or decommissioned webpages to help retain access for future generations. Essentially, the site captures snapshots of how a website used to be at a specific period of time.

**Uses:**

1.Nostalgia & Research

2.Content Recovery

3.Website Analysis

4.Digital Forensics & Investigation

5.Historical Preservation

**Working:**

**1.Crawl:** The Internet Archive's bots periodically scan public websites. 

**2.Archive:** Copies (snapshots) are saved to their servers.

**3.Access:** Users enter a URL and select a date from a timeline to view an archived version.
